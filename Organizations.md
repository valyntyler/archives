# Organizations

## Archives

This is us. We like us.

## Inter-Actief

We like Inter-Actief. They're cool. We're looking to be a committee of
Inter-Actief for as long as it takes us to become an Association with the UT.

## Abacus

We like Abacus too. A lot of people studying Applied Mathematics are interested
in Competitive Programming. It would be a good idea to work with them as much as
we can.
